## üí° Recommendations

### üéØ 1. Prioritize High-Performing Cities
- Expand presence in **Mysuru, Chennai, and Bengaluru** ‚Äî cities that generated the highest Incremental Revenue (IR).
- Reevaluate strategy and campaign execution in **Mangalore, Trivandrum, and Visakhapatnam**, which consistently underperformed.

---

### üßæ 2. Refine Promotion Strategy
- Scale up **500 Cashback** and **BOGOF** promotions ‚Äî proven to deliver strong IR and unit sales uplift.
- Discontinue or redesign **25% OFF** offers due to their negative impact on revenue and sales.
- Align promotion types with seasonal behavior:  
  - Use **BOGOF** during Sankranti for groceries  
  - Use **Cashback** during Diwali for electronics and high-value items

---

### üì¶ 3. Focus on High-Value Product Bundles
- Prioritize promotion of **combo packs** and **appliance bundles**, especially during festive seasons.
- Highlight high-IR items such as **Bedsheet Set**, **LED Bulb**, and **Home Essentials Combo**.

---

### üèôÔ∏è 4. Optimize Store Network by Region
- Invest in cities with strong store density and campaign response (e.g., Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad).
- Use store count and revenue correlation data to guide **future store expansion and resource allocation**.

---

### üß† 5. Personalization & Loyalty Programs
- Launch **loyalty rewards** for repeat buyers in top-performing product categories.
- Implement **region-based personalized offers** using segmentation from campaign performance data.

---

### üîÅ 6. Seasonal Timing Optimization
- Run high-value product campaigns during **Diwali**, which has shown stronger sales impact.
- Use **combo offers and daily-use essentials** during **Sankranti**, when value-focused shopping behavior is high.


## üéØ Conclusion

This campaign analysis reveals a surprising truth: **not all discounts drive value** ‚Äî and sometimes, **less flashy strategies like Cashback outperform heavy markdowns** like 25% OFF. By digging into store-level performance, category alignment, and promo timing, Atliq Mart can now make **data-backed decisions** instead of running on retail intuition.

What stands out is the **power of regional behavior**. Cities like Mysuru, Chennai, and Bengaluru weren't just high-volume ‚Äî they were strategically positioned for success, aided by store density and promotion fit. Meanwhile, lower-tier cities struggled, showing that **"one-size-fits-all" marketing no longer works** in India‚Äôs diverse retail landscape.

Perhaps most surprisingly, high-ticket items like **bedsheets, immersion rods, and appliance combos** emerged as the unexpected champions under BOGOF and Cashback schemes ‚Äî proving that customers are willing to spend more when value is structured right.

This project isn‚Äôt just a festive sales post-mortem ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **framework for smarter seasonal planning, regional targeting, and product bundling**. With the right mix of **data storytelling and strategic action**, Atliq Mart is well-positioned to turn future promotions into powerful revenue engines.
